# CrowdFunding Project
We have three contracts createFund, crowdFund & token contract.

Functionality

● Project owners can create a new crowdfunding project. <br>
● Every new crowdfunded project has a timeline and a funding goal.<br>
● Users can fund different projects within the timeline.<br>
● If the funds are not successfully raised by the time the campaign ends, users should.<br>
be able to withdraw their funds.<br>

● Ability to create and use modifiers appropriately.<br>
● Ability to create and emit events appropriately.<br>
● Ability to use contract inheritance appropriately.<br>
● Ability to validate conditions and throw sensible errors.<br>
● Ability to properly use global functions to access information about the

● Ability to choose appropriate memory types for parameters, variables,
etc.
