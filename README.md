# CrowdFunding Project
We have three contracts createFund, crowdFund & token contract.

Functionality
● Project owners can create a new crowdfunding project
● Every new crowdfunded project has a timeline and a funding goal
● Users can fund different projects within the timeline
● If the funds are not successfully raised by the time the campaign ends, users should
be able to withdraw their funds

In this project I have demonstrated
● Ability to create and use modifiers appropriately
● Ability to create and emit events appropriately
● Ability to use contract inheritance appropriately
● Ability to validate conditions and throw sensible errors
● Ability to properly use global functions to access information about the
transaction, block, address, etc.
● Ability to choose appropriate memory types for parameters, variables,
etc.
